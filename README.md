The Gaming Room Client and their requirements:
The Gaming Room is a company that required a specifially tailored gaming environment. Specifically one required for multiple platforms that would still be efficient and allow cross compatible gameplay. It was still required to be high performance and scalable.

Reflection on documentation:
Being meticulous I believe is somewhere I excelled. Paying close attention to technical requirements was a must. The template allowed for a lot of structure, and I tried to visualize the whole application. Breaking it down into pieces made it managable.

Areas for improvement:
If I were to revise anything, I would focus on scalability. I would make sure the product could adapt in our quickly changing environment. I would look ahead to upcoming software and architecture to make a state of the are product that would continue to be that way.

Intepreting user needs:
Understanding and implementing user needs was a cornerstone. This is the basis for everything, making an application usable by all and understandable by all. It needs to be intuitive, enjoyable, and efficient to not cause frustration.

Software deign approach:
My approach to designing software was systematic and user focused. I thought of what the everyday users would like and enjoy, and tried to base it off of that. That is the best you can get without live feedback loops and testing, but is smart. Similar to user stories with software developement, you want to turn a nontechnical description into a functional program.
